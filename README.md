# fun_with_cryptopals
- solutions to cryptopals exercises; updated periodically when I solve the next one

## Contents: 
- cryptopals-early.py has solutions to Set 1 Callenge 1 and 2 
- c3.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 3
- c4.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 4; text for this challenge is in c4file, a plain text file. 
- c5.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 5.  
- c7.py has one solution to Set 1 Challenge 7; text for this challenge is in c7file, a plain text file.    
HOWEVER, I used libraries to solve Challenge 7 and I'm not 100% happy about that. I found an explanation online that walks you through writing the actual code yourself. I've done enough reading to understand that "roll your own" crypto, as they tend to call it, is generally a bad idea; however, I won't be using this to encrypt anything, and I'd like to follow along and take a stab at it. So I will probably do that next and call it "c7-new.py" or something like that.
