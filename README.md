# fun_with_cryptopals
- solutions to cryptopals exercises; updated periodically when I solve the next one

## Contents: 
- cryptopals-early.py has solutions to Set 1 Callenge 1 and 2 
- c3.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 3
- c4.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 4; text for this challenge is in c4file, a plain text file. 
- c5.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 5.  
- c7.py has one solution to Set 1 Challenge 7; text for this challenge is in c7file, a plain text file.    
HOWEVER, I used libraries to solve Challenge 7 and I'm not 100% happy about that.  I'd like to take a stab at it without using libraries to do the heavy lifting. I found an explanation of AES-128 that goes into detail about the algorithm (linked in references for challenge 7) so when I have time, I'd like to try it.
- c8.py has solution to Set 1 Challenge 8; c8file has the text for that challenge.
